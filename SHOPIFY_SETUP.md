1. **Client ID** (API Key) - Copy this
2. **Client Secret** (API Secret Key) - Copy this  
3. **Webhook Secret** - Copy this

## Step 5: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with the credentials:

```env
# Shopify App Credentials
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-from-partner-dashboard"
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret-from-partner-dashboard"
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-webhook-secret-from-partner-dashboard"
```

## Step 6: Test the Integration

### 6.1 Install App in Development Store
1. Create a development store in Partner Dashboard
2. Install your app in the development store
3. Test the OAuth flow

### 6.2 Test Webhooks
Use ngrok or similar tool to expose your local server:
```bash
ngrok http 8081
```
Then update your webhook URLs in Partner Dashboard to use the ngrok URL.

## Step 7: Production Deployment

### 7.1 Update URLs for Production
- App URL: `https://yourdomain.com`
- Redirect URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/shopify/callback`
- Webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/shopify/webhook`

### 7.2 Submit for Review
Once your app is ready:
1. Complete all required sections in Partner Dashboard
2. Submit for Shopify review
3. Wait for approval before publishing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS errors:** Make sure your server has CORS middleware
2. **Webhook not receiving:** Check ngrok URL and webhook configuration
3. **OAuth errors:** Verify redirect URLs match exactly
4. **Permission errors:** Check API scopes in Partner Dashboard

### Testing Tools:
- **Shopify CLI:** For local development
- **ngrok:** For webhook testing
- **Postman:** For API testing
- **Shopify GraphQL Admin API:** For advanced queries

## Next Steps:
1. Complete the Partner Dashboard setup
2. Update your `.env` file with credentials
